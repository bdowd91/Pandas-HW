This is an analysis of the schools and students in a fictional school district. Each of the top five performing schools by passing rate are Charter schools while the bottom five performing schools by passing rate are all District Schools.  
Surprisingly, the overall passing rate drmatically declines as the spending range per students rises above $615. The average Score differential between Charter and District schools is smaller for reading than math.
